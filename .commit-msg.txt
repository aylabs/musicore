feat(023): multi-instrument Play View with layout engraving improvements

- Multi-instrument rendering: stacked staves with name labels, brackets,
  and barlines spanning all staves per instrument group
- Compact staff line spacing: reduced from 2x ups to 1x ups so noteheads
  fill the gap between lines (standard engraving proportion)
- Correct stem direction: notes on/above middle line get stems down,
  notes below get stems up (keeps notes inside the staff)
- Direction-aware note glyphs: unbeamed notes use Up/Down SMuFL variants
  (U+E1D3-E1DA) based on pitch position relative to middle line
- Tighter note spacing: SpacingConfig defaults reduced (base/factor/min=40,
  flag_padding=5, structural_padding=30) for 3+ measures per system
- Inter-staff gap: intra_staff_multiplier=14 prevents treble/bass overlap
  with room for ledger lines
- Ledger line width: reduced half-width from 1.25 to 0.7 ups (notehead-sized)
- Dynamic bracket glyph: spans actual top-to-bottom staff lines
- max_system_width=1600 for natural screen fit without horizontal scroll
- Fixed beam slope clamp bug using dx.abs() to prevent negative clamp range
- All 298 backend tests and 789 frontend tests pass
