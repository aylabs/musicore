## Feature 020: Measure Numbering + Layout Fixes + Playback UX

### Summary

Adds measure numbering to the layout engine, fixes several layout rendering bugs, and enhances playback interactivity.

### Changes

#### Measure Numbering (Feature 020)
- **Rust**: New `MeasureNumber` struct in layout types with `number: u32` and `position: Point`
- **Rust**: Compute 1-based measure number per system from tick ranges in `compute_layout()`
- **Frontend**: Render measure numbers in SVG using Bravura font at size 40, colored with `staffLineColor`
- **TypeScript**: `MeasureNumber` interface and optional `measure_number` field on `System`
- **Tests**: 8 unit tests + 2 integration tests covering sequential numbering, positioning, determinism, and multi-instrument scores

#### Layout Rendering Fixes
- **Double-offset bug**: System SVG groups no longer apply `bounding_box.y` in the translate transform — child elements already use absolute coordinates from the Rust layout engine
- **System overlap**: Compute effective system height dynamically based on the number of staves per instrument (was using a fixed value that was too small for 2-staff piano)
- **Bottom clipping**: Add 100-unit padding to `total_height` so the last system isn't cut off
- **More measures per system**: Increase `max_system_width` from 1200 to 2400, fitting 4-6 measures per system
- **Default zoom**: Set initial zoom to 50% for better score overview

#### Playback UX Enhancements
- **Auto-scroll**: Page automatically scrolls to follow the currently highlighted system during playback via `window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
- **Click/touch to toggle playback**: Clicking or tapping the score pauses/resumes playback

### Test Results
- **Rust**: 249 tests pass
- **Frontend**: 789 tests pass
- **WASM**: Rebuilt and validated
