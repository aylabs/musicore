 * matchRawNotesToSlots — pairs recorded notes to exercise slots by nearest timing.
 *
 * For each exercise slot, searches rawNotes for the closest note (by onset time)
 * that falls within one full beat period. This window catches detection latency
 * on the first beat while respecting genuine gaps.
 *
 * @param exercise  The target exercise (provides slot count and timing)
 * @param rawNotes  All ResponseNotes collected in temporal order
 * @returns         Per-slot responses (null = missed) + unmatched extraneous notes
